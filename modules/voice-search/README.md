# Add Voice Search

> **Important**
>
> - Voice search is supported only in Google Chrome browser, version 26 and above and only works on HTTPS URLs.
> - To get the best out of voice search, we advise enabling Klevuâ€™s Advanced NLP feature for your store. Enabling the Advanced NLP feature will ensure Klevu is able to understand and interpret long tail queries (i.e. anything beyond 5 words in a single query). If you are not sure whether you have this feature enabled or not, please contact us at support@klevu.com.
